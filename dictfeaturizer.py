class DictFeaturizer(object):
    """
    Featurize text by looking up words in dictionary categories.

    Usually, the dictionary categories are built in such a way that
    semantically or functionally similar words are grouped together.

    A good example of an application of such a Featurizer is the counting of
    swear words in a text for the detection of toxic behavior on social media.
    When naively counting these words, without grouping them beforehand, a
    machine learner might not discover that swear words are similar to each
    other.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dictionary : dict
        The dictionary to use. Each dictionary should have a string as key,
        and a list of words as value. These lists of words may contain
        wilcards in the form of '*' and '+'. These conform to their meanings in
        regular expressions, i.e., '*' implies that the wildcard may occur,
        while the '+' implies that it should occur.
    relative : bool
        Whether to return absolute or relative frequencies.

    Attributes
    ----------
    dict : dict
        A dictionary of tuples, the first item of each tuple contains a list
        of normal words, while the second item of each tuple is a list of words
        with wildcards.
